<h1>About the system</h1>
<p>The <a href="https://www.getrevue.co/profile/investingnewsletter/members">Stock Market Timing (SMT)</a> system aims to time entries and exits in the SPY ETF adopting a medium to long term investment style. The criteria for investment are a mix of quantitative tests and discretionary decisions. Quantitative methods include backtesting of rule-based strategies and statistical analysis of historical price movements. Discretionary decisions gauge the quantitative elements in the light of macroeconomic cycles, political events and money management. Performance wise the goal is to beat the SP500 by 10% annually. If the drawdown exceeds 20% the service is shut down.</p>
