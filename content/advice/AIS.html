<h1>About the system</h1>
<p>The <a href="https://www.getrevue.co/profile/investingnewsletter/members">Active Investor Signals (AIS)</a> system aims to trade individual stocks, stock index funds as well as a variety of ETFs adopting a medium to long term investment style. The criteria for investment are a mix of quantitative tests and discretionary decisions. Quantitative methods include backtesting of rule-based strategies and statistical analysis of historical price movements. Discretionary decisions gauge the quantitative elements in the light of macroeconomic cycles and money management. Performance wise the goal is to beat the SP500 by 10% annually.</p>
