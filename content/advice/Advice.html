<h1>Not thinking too much about your finances: KISS</h1>
<p>If you don’t want to think about your finances keep things simple and stupid (KISS). Regularly invest a portion (I suggest 15%-20%) of your revenue in stocks (I suggest <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/122215/spy-spdr-sp-500-trust-etf.asp">SPY</a>) and government bonds (I suggest <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/031915/overview-tlt-etf.asp">TLT</a>). The bigger your appetite for risk the higher the percentage invested in the <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/122215/spy-spdr-sp-500-trust-etf.asp">SPY</a>.</p>
<p>But let Warren Buffet explain you how powerfull index funds are… {{% youtube "10QoUi2PmNs" %}}</p>
<p>In my opinion, there are two important things to consider. The first is to commit to regularity and avoid exceptions becaouse your need money somewhere else. I would rather test the limits of my credit card than not wiring money to my brokerage account. The second is fees. Funds charge you a % for managing your money and, believe it or not, the lower the fees the better the performance. Both, <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/122215/spy-spdr-sp-500-trust-etf.asp">SPY</a> and <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/031915/overview-tlt-etf.asp">TLT</a> are cometitive but if you decide to use other instruments that’s ok. Your should simply avoid paying above 0.3%.</p>

<h1>Thinking about your finances</h1>
<p>If you want to think about your finances, be reassured I know that thinking about them is difficult. For one reason, because it involves feelings about what we do with our money? Some people may feel guilt for not saving enough and spending too much on leisure while others may be terrified and fear the thought of loosing their fortune. You might have feared that you are about to miss out on a great opportunity everybondy is profiting from (remember bitcoins). Whatever the emotions are that you attach to your finances a good advice would be to avoid getting trapped by them.</p>
<p>Another reason why some people avoit thinking about their finances is that it takes time. Most of us are already dedicating a lot of our efforts to our jobs or businesses and it is already hard to switch our thoughts to our dear ones at dinner. We are so much into our daily routines that thinking about our finances and investments is simply too much.</p>
<p>But lets take a moment to think about why we should care about how to invest our hard earned money.</p>
