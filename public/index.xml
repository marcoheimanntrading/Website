      <description>About the systemThe Active Investor Signals (AIS) system aims to trade individual stocks, stock index funds as well as a variety of ETFs adopting a medium to long term investment style. The criteria for investment are a mix of quantitative tests and discretionary decisions. Quantitative methods include backtesting of rule-based strategies and statistical analysis of historical price movements. Discretionary decisions gauge the quantitative elements in the light of macroeconomic cycles and money management.</description>
